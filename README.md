## Open source issue tracker project
### What is it?
Doortracker is a open source issue tracker with a new responsive theme built using Laravel PHP Framework. DoorTracker was created to managing bug, without paying extortionate service fees.

> PLEASE NOTE: DoorTracker is in the early stages of development and therefore is likely to contain bugs and unfinished features. Be wary about using DoorTracker in a production environment.
