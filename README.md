## Open source issue tracker project
### What is it?
Doortracker is an open source issue tracker with a new responsive theme built using Laravel PHP Framework. DoorTracker was created to managing bugs, without paying extortionate service fees.

> PLEASE NOTE: DoorTracker is at an early development stage therefore is likely to contain bugs and unfinished features. Be careful about using DoorTracker in a production environment.
